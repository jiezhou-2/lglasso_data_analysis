# Supplementary Materials for Reproducibility

This website demonstrate the specific procedures adopted to reproduce the 
results in the paper <Identifying Microbial Interaction Networks Based on Irregularly Spaced Longitudinal 16S rRNA sequence data>. 

## Simulation

### Data from SGGM 

[Code for Figure 1.](figure1.html)


[Code for Table 1.](table1.html)

### Data from general GGM


## Real data

### Estimate the network 

[Code for Figure 2.](network_real_data.html)

### Validated the estimated network
